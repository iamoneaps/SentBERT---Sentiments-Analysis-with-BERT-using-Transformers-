# SentBERT---Sentiments-Analysis-with-BERT-using-Transformers-
 Sentiment Analysis with BERT using Transformers employs state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to analyze text sentiment accurately and efficiently.

Natural Language Processing remains one of the toughest tasks for computers, both in terms of accuracy and computing power. In this project, we have tackled the problem statement given on sentiment analysis in the assignment handout. More specifically, we will examine different types of neural network architectures and their effects on model accuracy, computation time, and efficiency. Furthermore, we have addressed the two additional sub- problems provided as follows:

To deal with domain adaptation, that is, how can one adapt a network train on one domain to work in another domain.
To deal with small datasets, that is, with insufficient number of training samples.
